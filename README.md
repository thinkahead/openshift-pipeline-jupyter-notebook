# Openshift Pipelines to build a jupyter image and deploy 

### Clone the repository and update the parameters
```
git cloneÂ  https://github.com/thinkahead/openshift-pipeline-jupyter-notebook
cd openshift-pipeline-jupyter-notebook
vi pipeline/04-pipelinerun.yaml # Edit the deployment name, image etc
vi openshift/deploymentconfig.yaml # Edit the JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD default test1234
```

### Run the pipeline and wait for it to complete
The build-and-deploy-run pipeline run will build the base image with the build-image (buildah) and deploy it with oc-apply-deployment task.
```
oc apply -f pipeline/ -n alexei
time tkn pr logs build-and-deploy-run -n alexei -f # 30 minutes
```

### Get the route
Run the digits.ipynb notebook at the url from the route, password test1234.
```
oc get routes
```

### If there is an error, you can delete the pipeline run and redeploy
```
oc delete pr build-and-deploy-run -n alexei
oc apply -f pipeline/04-pipelinerun.yaml -n alexei
```

### Delete the deployed jupyter notebook
```
oc -n alexei delete all,configmap,pvc,serviceaccount,rolebinding,buildconfig --selector app=madi-pipeline
```

### Delete the pipeline and pvc
```
oc delete -f pipeline/ -n alexei
```
